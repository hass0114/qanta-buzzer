You are conducting the **third and final** code review of a Stanford CS234 final project codebase called **qanta-buzzer** at commit `cbaa6f41`. The three attached Markdown files are line-numbered Repomix snapshots containing the complete repository.

## What has already been reviewed and fixed

Two prior review rounds found and fixed **12 issues total**:

**Review 1** (commit `fd34e25a`, 7 issues):
1. `DSPyLikelihood` didn't inherit `LikelihoodModel` — fixed
2. `score()` had no shape validation — fixed with ndim+length check
3. `dspy.enabled` config key existed but was never read — removed
4. Config comment listed non-existent `embedding_based` strategy — corrected
5. Module docstring falsely claimed dspy was required for import — rewritten
6. `test_changed_fingerprint_invalidates` was too weak — rewritten to test keys directly
7. `test_fallback_to_existing` name was misleading — split into two accurate tests

**Review 2** (commit `c912c814`, 5 issues):
1. Optimizer metric was constant `lambda: 1.0` — replaced with argmax-based `_score_metric`
2. Trainset loaded combined `mc_dataset.json` instead of train split — now uses `train_dataset.json`
3. `build_dspy_profiles` docstring claimed leave-one-out it couldn't enforce — corrected
4. Silent `except Exception` in profile augmentation — added logging
5. `test_compile_requires_dspy` never called the function — added `test_score_metric_logic` and `test_trainset_uses_mid_prefix`

**Do not re-report any of the above 12 items.** They are fixed in the current snapshot.

## Current state

- 357 tests pass, 3 skipped (optional extras not installed)
- Smoke pipeline and T5 smoke both green
- Three opt-in extensions: Expected Wins, Variable-K, DSPy (all disabled by default)
- Optional extras: `[openai]`, `[maskable]`, `[dspy]`

## Anti-hallucination rules

1. **Every claim must cite `file.py:LINE`** using the line numbers in the attached files.
2. **Quote the exact code** that is wrong.
3. **No evidence in attachments → do not report it.**
4. **Distinguish VERIFIED ISSUE from POTENTIAL CONCERN.**
5. **Do not re-report the 12 fixed issues above or the known risks listed in `.planning/quick/extensions-master-run.md:56-63`.**
6. **Style preferences are not bugs.**

## Known risks (already documented, do not re-report)

These are explicitly documented in `.planning/quick/extensions-master-run.md` and `.planning/STATE.md`:

1. Full 100k PPO training run not verified end-to-end
2. SBERT/T5-large likelihood paths not exercised locally
3. MaskablePPO path now has focused unit coverage, but still lacks a full long-running `sb3-contrib` integration training pass
4. DSPy compile/optimize requires live LM backend not tested locally
5. compare_policies S_q/reward comparisons remain qualitative across architectures
6. TF-IDF cache memory grows with corpus size

## Review scope

This is a **convergence review**. The goal is to find anything that two prior rounds missed, with particular attention to:

### A. Cross-extension interaction bugs

The three extensions (EW, Variable-K, DSPy) were built independently. Check for interactions that could break:

1. **EW + Variable-K**: If `variable_K=True` and `reward_mode=expected_wins`, does the opponent model receive the correct per-question step count? Does the EW reward formula still work when `belief.shape` varies per episode?

2. **DSPy + the env pipeline**: If `likelihood.model=dspy`, trace every code path from `build_likelihood_from_config()` through `TossupMCEnv._compute_belief()` to `extract_belief_features()`. Does `DSPyLikelihood.score()` integrate cleanly, or does any caller along the way invoke `embed_and_cache()` / `precompute_embeddings()` which would raise `NotImplementedError`?

3. **Variable-K + PPO**: In variable-K mode with padded observations, if the PPO agent samples an action in the padded range (action > K_actual), what happens in `TossupMCEnv.step()`? Is there a guard, or does it silently index out of bounds?

4. **EW + evaluation**: `expected_wins_score()` requires an `opponent_survival_trace`. When `evaluate_all.py` runs with EW enabled, does it construct and pass this trace correctly for each question, or does it use a fixed dummy?

### B. Data contract holes

1. Does `MCQuestion` serialization (via `dataclasses.asdict` → JSON) and deserialization (via `load_mc_questions`) round-trip correctly for variable-K questions where different questions have different `len(options)`?

2. Does `_PrecomputedQuestion.num_options` in `agents/threshold_buzzer.py` stay correct for variable-K questions, or does it get set to some fixed K?

3. When `precompute_beliefs()` in `qb_env/tossup_env.py` runs on a mixed-K question pool, does it handle questions with different `len(option_profiles)` correctly, or does it assume a fixed K?

### C. Config validation gaps

1. If someone sets `environment.reward_mode: expected_wins` but does NOT configure `opponent_buzz_model` (or sets it to `type: none`), what happens at runtime? Does the env gracefully degrade, crash, or silently produce wrong rewards?

2. If someone sets `data.variable_K: true` but `data.min_K` > `data.K`, what happens in `MCBuilder._target_k()`?

3. If someone sets both `data.variable_K: true` and `ppo.algorithm: maskable_ppo` but does NOT install `sb3-contrib`, what error do they get? Is it actionable?

### D. Numerical edge cases

1. In `expected_wins_score()` (`evaluation/metrics.py`), what happens when `opponent_survival_trace` has length < `c_trace`? The function uses `n = min(len(c), len(g), len(s))` — is that truncation correct or lossy?

2. In `extract_padded_belief_features()` (`models/features.py`), if `len(belief) > max_K` (belief is larger than the padded target), the function does `padded[:K_actual] = belief[:max_K]`. Is this truncation correct, or should it raise?

3. In `LogisticOpponentModel.prob_buzzed_before_step()`, what happens when `total = len(question.cumulative_prefixes) = 0`?

### E. Test weakness audit

For each test file in `tests/`, identify:
- Tests whose assertions are so weak they would pass even if the implementation were wrong
- Production code paths exercised by zero tests
- Tests whose names/docstrings don't match what they actually verify

Focus on the extension test files:
- `tests/test_opponent_models.py`
- `tests/test_environment.py` (Expected Wins and Variable-K sections)
- `tests/test_mc_builder_variable_k.py`
- `tests/test_variable_k_integration.py`
- `tests/test_dspy_likelihood.py`
- `tests/test_dspy_optimize.py`
- `tests/test_dspy_answer_profiles.py`
- `tests/test_features.py` (padded features section)
- `tests/test_ppo_buzzer.py` (MaskablePPO section)

### F. Documentation-code consistency

Verify these specific factual claims against the code:

1. README says "360 tests across 27 test files" — count the actual `test_*.py` files in the tests/ directory listing and test count in the attached code
2. README says "Four reward modes: time_penalty, simple, human_grounded, expected_wins" — verify `_buzz_reward()` in `tossup_env.py` dispatches all four
3. AGENTS.md says `evaluation/` contains "Expected Wins" — verify `expected_wins_score` exists in `evaluation/metrics.py`
4. The `dspy` config section in `default.yaml` — verify every key is read by some code path
5. The `opponent_buzz_model` config section — verify every key is read by `build_opponent_model_from_config()`
