**User**

Read this entire prompt first. Then read the repo before editing anything.

You are working locally in the qanta-buzzer repo inside Cursor Agent.

Operating mode:
- Local agent only
- Claude 4 Opus Max
- Thinking enabled
- Max Mode enabled

Mission:
Semantically reconcile the review-remediation content associated with upstream PR #1 into the current local repo.
This is NOT a literal cherry-pick from the older upstream GitHub repo.
The local repo is newer and already contains the extension campaign plus later review fixes.
Your job is to verify current alignment and make only the minimal reconciliation edits that are still needed.

Hard rules:
- Do not use Cloud Agent
- Do not use worktrees or extra branches unless explicitly asked
- Do not touch the root-level legacy prototype files except to verify that they remain non-canonical
- Do not regress the current modular architecture
- Do not re-open the extension campaign
- Preserve default behavior:
  - smoke pipeline unchanged when extensions are off
  - T5 smoke unchanged when extensions are off
  - Expected Wins / Variable-K / DSPy remain opt-in
- One work package at a time
- After each work package:
  - run only the listed verification commands
  - if files changed, make one commit
  - if already aligned, report VERIFIED-CLOSED and do not force a no-op commit
  - STOP and wait for the next work package prompt

Create a reconciliation ledger immediately:
- File: .planning/quick/pr1-reconciliation.md
- Track for each work package:
  - objective
  - repo evidence checked
  - files changed
  - tests run
  - result: completed | verified_closed | blocked
  - commit hash (if any)
  - rollback command (if any)
  - remaining notes

Before editing anything, read at minimum:
1. AGENTS.md
2. README.md
3. .planning/quick/extensions-master-run.md
4. .planning/STATE.md
5. scripts/ci.sh
6. scripts/manual-smoke.sh
7. the code paths named in the current work package

Stop after setting up the ledger and summarizing the current repo state in 5-10 bullet points.
Do not edit production code yet.

**Cursor**

Let me start by reading all the required files before doing anything else.

Now let me read the CI script, manual-smoke script, and the PR #1 integration plan.

Let me check the current git state and repo structure to complete my understanding.

Let me verify the current test baseline and look at the PR #1 branch content.

Now I have a thorough understanding of the repo. Let me create the reconciliation ledger and summarize.

Ledger created. Here is my summary of the current repo state:

---

**Current repo state (10 bullet points):**

1. **Local HEAD is `9664c487` on `main`** — 220+ commits, roughly 72 commits ahead of the PR #1 base (`personal/main`). The PR branch has only 2 commits (`4f3e3009`, `f459f246`) and is stale with unresolved merge conflicts against local.

2. **Extension campaign is complete (18 patches)** — Expected Wins (EW-01..04), Variable-K (VK-01..07), DSPy (DSPY-01..05), plus final docs and two ChatGPT review rounds. All tracked in `.planning/quick/extensions-master-run.md`.

3. **360 tests across 27 files (3 skipped)** — CI via `scripts/ci.sh` runs `pytest tests/`. Skips are for optional extras (MaskablePPO, DSPy).

4. **Smoke pipeline is green** — `scripts/manual-smoke.sh` runs four stages (build_mc_dataset, run_baselines, train_ppo, evaluate_all) with `--smoke` flag, outputs to `artifacts/smoke/`.

5. **PR #1 introduces 7 features across 23 files (+530/-153)** — factored T5 action semantics, StopOnlyEnv, `--policy-mode`, `end_mode`/`no_buzz_reward`, `p_correct_trace` rename, hazard pretraining bridge, and integration tests. Five known bugs are documented, two at P1 severity.

6. **Integration plan already exists** at `.planning/quick/pr1-integration-plan.md` — breaks PR into 4 independent patches (A: T5 math, B: StopOnlyEnv, C: end_mode, D: hazard pretrain), with explicit exclusions for the `p_correct_trace` rename and calibration rewrite that would regress local fixes.

7. **`top_p_trace` is the canonical confidence field** for calibration — introduced during remediation, verified across 3 review rounds. The PR's `p_correct_trace` rename is explicitly excluded because its `@property` shim breaks `asdict()`.

8. **Root-level legacy files remain non-canonical** — pre-modularization prototypes still exist at the repo root, are not installed via `setup.py`, and are preserved for reference / backward compatibility.

9. **v1.0 milestone is complete** per `.planning/STATE.md` — all 6 phases done, 19/20 plans complete. Next priority is CS234 writeup and full training runs.

10. **10 optimization quick tasks completed** (repo-contract scaffolding, precomputed beliefs, embedding cache persistence, baseline sweep collapse, profile caching, top-M argpartition, TF-IDF caching, precomputed shuffle control, final verification, ci.sh fix) — all verified and committed.

---

The reconciliation ledger is at `.planning/quick/pr1-reconciliation.md` with 5 work packages (A through D plus cross-cutting tests), explicit exclusions, and invariant checklist. Ready for the first work package prompt.

Implement WP1 only.

WP1 objective:
Reconcile the DSPy likelihood/factory contract surface with the current local repo.
This is a verify-then-edit step. The likely outcome is small edits or VERIFIED-CLOSED.

Edit only these files if needed:
- models/dspy_likelihood.py
- models/likelihoods.py
- tests/test_dspy_likelihood.py
- tests/test_factories.py
- configs/default.yaml
- README.md or AGENTS.md only if a public DSPy contract statement is still stale

What to verify:
1. DSPyLikelihood is a real LikelihoodModel subclass
2. score() enforces the (K,) contract
3. any stale dspy.enabled activation knob is gone or no longer misleading
4. DSPy importability/runtime docs are truthful
5. fingerprint/cache tests actually prove fingerprint-sensitive behavior
6. factory dispatch for likelihood.model: dspy is consistent with the current local config contract

What to change if needed:
- only the minimum necessary to align those contracts
- do not widen scope beyond DSPy likelihood/factory/tests/docs

Verification commands:
- pytest tests/test_dspy_likelihood.py tests/test_factories.py -q

Commit message if files changed:
review(pr1): reconcile DSPy likelihood contract with current local repo

Stop here after:
- updating .planning/quick/pr1-reconciliation.md
- running the verification commands
- committing if needed
- reporting:
  - VERIFIED-CLOSED or COMPLETED
  - files changed
  - commands run
  - pass/fail
  - rollback command if a commit was made

Let me read all six target files before making any decisions.

Let me check a few more things to complete the verification — smoke config, models init, and any stale `dspy.enabled` references.

All six verification checkpoints examined. Let me now run the specified tests and then update the ledger.

All 24 tests pass. Now let me update the reconciliation ledger.

**Result: VERIFIED-CLOSED**

Verification summary for WP-1 (DSPy Likelihood / Factory Contract Surface):

| Checkpoint | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 1. `DSPyLikelihood` is a real `LikelihoodModel` subclass | Verified — inherits `LikelihoodModel`, calls `super().__init__()`, test confirms `isinstance` |
| 2. `score()` enforces the `(K,)` contract | Verified — validates `ndim==1` and `len==expected_k`, test covers bad-scorer `ValueError` |
| 3. Stale `dspy.enabled` knob is gone | Verified — no `enabled` key in any config; default.yaml comment explicitly says "no separate enable flag"; removal tracked to commit `fd34e25a` |
| 4. DSPy importability/runtime docs are truthful | Verified — module imports only numpy/hashlib/json/Path (no `dspy` at module level); README and AGENTS correctly describe opt-in via `pip install -e '.[dspy]'` |
| 5. Fingerprint/cache tests prove fingerprint-sensitive behavior | Verified — `test_changed_fingerprint_invalidates` proves distinct keys per fingerprint + correct cache population; `test_repeated_call_hits_cache` proves cache hit with call counting |
| 6. Factory dispatch for `likelihood.model: dspy` is consistent | Verified — factory reads `dspy.cache_dir` / `dspy.program_fingerprint` with "default" fallback; `TestDSPyFactoryIntegration` covers dispatch and non-interference |

- **Files changed:** none
- **Commands run:** `pytest tests/test_dspy_likelihood.py tests/test_factories.py -q` — 24 passed, 0.06s
- **Pass/fail:** pass
- **Rollback command:** n/a (no commit)

Implement WP2 only.

WP2 objective:
Reconcile the DSPy offline compile/optimize path with the current local repo.

Edit only these files if needed:
- scripts/optimize_dspy.py
- tests/test_dspy_optimize.py

What to verify:
1. the optimizer metric is real, not a constant placeholder
2. the trainset is built from the train split artifact, not the combined MC dataset
3. the compile path remains offline-oriented and unit-testable without a live LM backend
4. tests actually execute the helper logic they claim to validate

What to change if needed:
- only minimal edits in optimize_dspy.py and its tests
- do not touch unrelated DSPy files in this work package

Verification commands:
- pytest tests/test_dspy_optimize.py -q

Commit message if files changed:
review(pr1): reconcile DSPy compile path with split-aware workflow

Stop here after:
- updating .planning/quick/pr1-reconciliation.md
- running the verification commands
- committing if needed
- reporting:
  - VERIFIED-CLOSED or COMPLETED
  - files changed
  - commands run
  - pass/fail
  - rollback command if a commit was made

Let me also check what `build_mc_dataset.py` produces, to verify the train-split path in `optimize_dspy.py` is reachable.

I've found one substantive gap: `test_score_metric_logic` duplicates the `_score_metric` function locally rather than testing the real one. The real `_score_metric` is trapped inside `compile_dspy_scorer()` as a local function, making it unimportable. The fix is to extract it to module level. It has no closure dependencies — just `json.loads`.

Let me make the minimal extraction.

Now update the test to import and test the real `_score_metric` instead of duplicating it.

Now run the verification tests.

5 passed, 1 skipped (the `test_compile_requires_dspy` skip is expected — dspy not installed locally). Let me verify the final file states are clean.

Clean. Now update the ledger and commit.

**Result: COMPLETED**

Verification summary for WP-2 (DSPy Offline Compile / Optimize Path):

| Checkpoint | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 1. Optimizer metric is real, not a constant placeholder | Verified — `_score_metric` does argmax comparison (fixed in REVIEW-2 commit c912c814) |
| 2. Trainset uses train split artifact | Verified — `main()` prefers `train_dataset.json` with fallback + warning; `build_mc_dataset.py` line 332 confirms the file is produced |
| 3. Compile path is offline-oriented and unit-testable | Verified — `compile_dspy_scorer()` requires dspy only at runtime; `build_dspy_trainset()` and `_score_metric` work without it |
| 4. Tests execute the helper logic they claim to validate | **Fixed** — extracted `_score_metric` from closure to module level; test now imports and validates the real function |

- **Files changed:** `scripts/optimize_dspy.py`, `tests/test_dspy_optimize.py`
- **Commands run:** `pytest tests/test_dspy_optimize.py -q` — 5 passed, 1 skipped, 0.02s
- **Pass/fail:** pass
- **Commit hash:** `63c66c05`
- **Rollback command:** `git revert 63c66c05`

Implement WP3 only.

WP3 objective:
Reconcile DSPy answer-profile fallback/doc/test behavior with the current local repo.

Edit only these files if needed:
- qb_data/dspy_answer_profiles.py
- tests/test_dspy_answer_profiles.py

What to verify:
1. docstrings do not overclaim leave-one-out guarantees beyond what this helper can actually enforce
2. fallback behavior logs or otherwise surfaces augmentation failure truthfully
3. test names and test bodies match the actual behavior being verified
4. any earlier misleading test naming or behavior drift is fully resolved

What to change if needed:
- keep the default extractive AnswerProfileBuilder path untouched
- keep DSPy augmentation opt-in
- only minimal edits in these two files unless a tiny README/AGENTS note is strictly required

Verification commands:
- pytest tests/test_dspy_answer_profiles.py -q

Commit message if files changed:
review(pr1): reconcile DSPy answer-profile fallback docs and tests

Stop here after:
- updating .planning/quick/pr1-reconciliation.md
- running the verification commands
- committing if needed
- reporting:
  - VERIFIED-CLOSED or COMPLETED
  - files changed
  - commands run
  - pass/fail
  - rollback command if a commit was made

**Cursor**

Let me run the verification tests now, then report.

2 passed, 1 skipped (the `test_with_dspy_installed` skip is expected — dspy not installed locally). All four checkpoints pass. Let me update the ledger.

No production or test files changed, so no commit needed. The ledger update is planning-only.

**Result: VERIFIED-CLOSED**

Verification summary for WP-3 (DSPy Answer-Profile Fallback / Doc / Test Behavior):

| Checkpoint | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 1. Docstrings don't overclaim leave-one-out | Verified — explicit disclaimer at lines 23-27: "This function itself does not receive per-question exclusion context — it augments whatever profiles it is given" |
| 2. Fallback logs truthfully | Verified — `logger.warning` per-answer on failure (line 80), `logger.info` summary with augmented/fallback counts (lines 87-91); fixed in REVIEW-2 |
| 3. Test names match test bodies | Verified — all three tests do exactly what their names claim |
| 4. No misleading naming or behavior drift | Verified — REVIEW-2 resolved the prior "silent except" issue; no residual drift |

- **Files changed:** none
- **Commands run:** `pytest tests/test_dspy_answer_profiles.py -q` — 2 passed, 1 skipped, 0.01s
- **Pass/fail:** pass
- **Rollback command:** n/a (no commit)

Implement WP4 only.

WP4 objective:
Make the local repo’s durable docs explicitly reflect that the semantic content of upstream PR #1 is already absorbed here.

Edit only these files if needed:
- .planning/quick/pr1-reconciliation.md
- .planning/quick/extensions-master-run.md
- .planning/STATE.md
- README.md
- AGENTS.md
- CLAUDE.md only if absolutely necessary

What to verify:
1. docs clearly reflect the current local reality, not the older upstream repo
2. the repo still presents the modular scripts pipeline as canonical
3. the three extensions remain documented as opt-in
4. the current validation status remains truthful
5. any mention of PR #1 is framed as consolidation/reconciliation, not as an instruction to regress to the older upstream structure

What to change if needed:
- add a concise note that PR #1’s review-remediation content is already represented in the current local branch
- do not rewrite unrelated docs
- preserve the current smoke/T5 smoke and optional-extra guidance

Verification commands:
- pytest tests/test_dspy_likelihood.py tests/test_dspy_optimize.py tests/test_dspy_answer_profiles.py tests/test_factories.py -q

Commit message if files changed:
docs(pr1): consolidate review remediation in current local repo

Stop here after:
- updating .planning/quick/pr1-reconciliation.md
- running the verification commands
- committing if needed
- reporting:
  - VERIFIED-CLOSED or COMPLETED
  - files changed
  - commands run
  - pass/fail
  - rollback command if a commit was made

Now let me check all five doc checkpoints systematically against the current state.

All five checkpoints are essentially met already. The one stale element is `STATE.md`'s session continuity — it describes the extension campaign but not the ongoing PR #1 reconciliation. Let me make the minimal truthfulness update.

Now add a brief cross-reference in the extensions master run ledger so the two ledgers are linked.

Now update the reconciliation ledger itself for WP-4.

Now run the verification commands.

31 passed, 2 skipped. Now commit.

**Result: COMPLETED**

Verification summary for WP-4 (Durable Docs — PR #1 Absorption Statement):

| Checkpoint | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 1. Docs reflect current local reality | Verified — README, AGENTS, CLAUDE all describe modular pipeline, correct test counts, local architecture; no stale upstream references |
| 2. Modular scripts pipeline presented as canonical | Verified — README "The canonical four-stage smoke pipeline"; AGENTS "Smoke Pipeline" section with `scripts/` commands |
| 3. Three extensions documented as opt-in | Verified — README "All are disabled by default — the smoke pipeline and T5 smoke path work unchanged"; AGENTS "Three opt-in extensions" |
| 4. Validation status truthful | Verified — current docs should state 360 tests across 27 test files (3 skipped) |
| 5. PR #1 framed as consolidation/reconciliation | Verified — no PR #1 mention in public docs; STATE.md and extensions ledger now cross-reference the reconciliation ledger |

- **Files changed:** `.planning/STATE.md`, `.planning/quick/extensions-master-run.md`
- **Commands run:** `pytest tests/test_dspy_likelihood.py tests/test_dspy_optimize.py tests/test_dspy_answer_profiles.py tests/test_factories.py -q` — 31 passed, 2 skipped, 0.07s
- **Pass/fail:** pass
- **Commit hash:** `acff2bbb`
- **Rollback command:** `git revert acff2bbb`

Run the final reconciliation verification for the PR #1 semantic port.

Do not widen scope. Do not add new features.

Run exactly:
1. pytest tests/test_dspy_likelihood.py tests/test_dspy_optimize.py tests/test_dspy_answer_profiles.py tests/test_factories.py -q
2. pytest -q
3. bash scripts/manual-smoke.sh
4. python scripts/train_t5_policy.py --config configs/t5_policy.yaml --smoke

Then update .planning/quick/pr1-reconciliation.md with:
- final status for each work package
- commits made
- files changed
- commands run
- pass/fail summary
- any verified no-op / already-aligned areas
- any remaining risks that are genuinely still open

Stop after producing one final reconciliation report.

**Cursor**

Running all four verification commands.

Both test runs green. Now the smoke pipeline.

4/4 stages complete. Now the T5 smoke.

All four commands green. Let me now read the current reconciliation ledger and produce the final report.

Now I have everything. Let me write the final reconciliation report.

**Final Reconciliation Report — PR #1 Semantic Port (DSPy Review-Remediation)**

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| DSPy + factory targeted tests | **31 passed, 2 skipped** (0.06s) |
| Full test suite | **357 passed, 3 skipped** (current branch) |
| Manual smoke pipeline | **4/4 stages complete** (10.6s) |
| T5 smoke (supervised + PPO) | **62.5% test accuracy** (23.9s) |

**Work package outcomes:**

| WP | Result | Detail |
|----|--------|--------|
| WP-1 | verified_closed | All 6 DSPy likelihood/factory contract checkpoints already aligned |
| WP-2 | completed | One fix: extracted `_score_metric` to module level so test validates real code (commit `63c66c05`) |
| WP-3 | verified_closed | Docstrings, fallback logging, test names all already correct post-REVIEW-2 |
| WP-4 | completed | STATE.md + extensions ledger updated with absorption statement (commit `acff2bbb`) |
| WP-A–D, X | deferred | New features from PR #1, not review-remediation. Tracked in ledger for future work. |

**Production files changed:** 1 (`scripts/optimize_dspy.py`)
**Test files changed:** 1 (`tests/test_dspy_optimize.py`)
**Test regressions:** 0
**Invariants verified:** all 6 hold

The one genuinely open risk is WP-A (T5 joint action factorization) — highest value deferred item that would improve T5 PPO training quality. Everything else is either pre-existing or blocked on PR bug fixes.
