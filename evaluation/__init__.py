Evaluation Package

Metrics computation for quiz bowl buzzer agents, including S_q scoring,
calibration analysis (ECE, Brier score), and buzz timing statistics.

Ported from qb-rl reference implementation with adaptations for
qanta-buzzer's EpisodeResult / SoftmaxEpisodeResult / PPOEpisodeTrace
dataclass structures.
